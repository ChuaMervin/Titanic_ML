# Predicting the survival of the passenger on Titanic
Data Science project that utilizes machine learning models to predict the survival outcome of the passenger on the Titanic shipwreck.
## Project Overview
*	The data set was obtained from the Kaggle competition Titanic â€“ Machine Learning from Disaster.
*	Import the dataset by using the pandas library.
*	Test and check on how well each feature correlate with survival.
*	Convert categorical features into numerical values so that it can be feed into the machine learning models.
*	Dropping features that are highly incomplete and do not really contribute in predicting the survival outcome of the passengers.
*	Making use of machine learning models [Logistic Regression, KNN or k-Nearest Neighbours, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forrest] to train and predict the required solution
*	K Stratified fold was also used to cross validate the data.
*	Sieving out the best model and using it to predict the solution.
*	Appending the result into an excel file and upload it into the Kaggle competition

## Resources Used
* Python Version: 3.7
* Packages: pandas, numpy, random, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn
